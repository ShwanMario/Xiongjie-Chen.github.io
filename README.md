# Welcome to My GitHub Pages
I'm a first year PhD student at the University of surrey in computer science, my research interests mainly focus on **Statistical Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision**. I very much enjoy "playing" with math and codes, especially finding the interesting facts and beautiful structures behind the seemly random data.

Now I'm working on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Optimial Transport (OT theory) and Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and their applications. See my github page via [this link](https://github.com/ShwanMario/).


## Educational Background

I am currently a Ph.D. student working on **Machine Learning** at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) under the supervisor of [Dr. Yunpeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=JzyKdRUAAAAJ). I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics at the Fujian University of Technology and my M.Eng. degree at Tongji University.

## Research interests

I am interested in generative models such as VAE and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and combining them with the normalizing flow and optimal transport theory. I recently worked on [generalizing sliced wasserstein distance](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8319-generalized-sliced-wasserstein-distances) by selecting the form of radon transform. [See this ongoing project here](https://github.com/ShwanMario/max_sliced_wasserstein_distance). 

Before joined the [NATURE INSPIRED COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING (NICE) RESEARCH GROUP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/nature-inspired-computing-and-engineering-research-group), I worked on computer vision from the aspect of its application. During my master's degree, I published one [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8665037) and one [journal paper](http://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/Detail.aspx?dbname=CAPJLAST&filename=TJDZ2019082900L&v=) on visual crowd counting based on convolutional neural network.
